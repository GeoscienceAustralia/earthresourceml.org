# EarthResourceML

EarthResourceML is an XML-based data transfer standard for the exchange of digital information for mineral occurrences, mines and mining activity. The model describes the geological features of mineral occurrences, their commodities, mineral resources and reserves. It is also able to describe mines and mining activities, and the production of concentrates, refined products, and waste materials.

### EarthResourceML-Lite - version 2.0

###  ![new](http://www.geosciml.org/theme/img/new.gif) [_EarthResourceML-Lite version 2.0.1 released - October 2018_](http://www.earthresourceml.org/earthresourceml-lite/2.0.1/)

EarthResourceML-Lite is a model and schema for simple map services (eg, WMS and WFS Simple Features).  It is an abridged version of the full EarthResourceML model and can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.

The v2.0.1 release corrects minor omissions in the CommodityResourceView and MiningWasteView schemas, but is otherwise compatible with v2.0.0.
